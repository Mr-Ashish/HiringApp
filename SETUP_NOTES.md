# Setup and Debugging Notes

## Current Status

- Project initialized with Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Prisma schema updated with User, Client, Mandate, Candidate, and join tables
- Database connection verified and migrations applied
- Prisma client generated and used in API routes
- Authentication flow implemented (NextAuth, registration endpoint, password hashing, session protection)
- Middleware for route protection in place
- Frontend auth pages (login and register) created and styled
- Sidebar navigation implemented (collapsible, tooltips, logout dropdown, user info)
- Sidebar hidden on login/register pages
- Sidebar and main content layout responsive to sidebar state
- CRUD logic for clients implemented (API + UI)
- Dashboard page scaffolded with new layout

## Steps to Debug and Fix

### 1. Prisma Schema & Database

- [x] Add missing Candidate model
- [x] Add proper relations between models
- [x] Add location and website to Client model
- [ ] Add file upload handling for resumes (to be handled in API/routes)
- [ ] Add audit trail fields where needed (future enhancement)

### 2. Database Connection

- [x] Verify DATABASE_URL in .env file
- [x] Test database connection
- [x] Run initial migration

### 3. Dependencies Check

- [x] Verify all required packages are installed
- [x] Check for version conflicts
- [x] Ensure Prisma CLI is properly installed
- [x] Install and configure react-icons

### 4. UI/UX & Layout Decisions

- [x] Sidebar is collapsible and defaults to collapsed (icon-only) after login
- [x] Sidebar tooltips on hover when collapsed
- [x] Sidebar includes: Overview, Clients, Mandates, Candidates, and user info with logout dropdown
- [x] Sidebar hidden on /login and /register pages
- [x] Logout dropdown closes on outside click
- [x] Main content area autosizes margin based on sidebar state
- [x] No left margin/space on login/register pages
- [x] Dashboard and all authenticated pages use the new layout
- [x] All navigation and section links are now in the left sidebar
- [x] Top bar removed for a cleaner, focused workspace

## Next Steps for Phase 1 (when resuming)

1. **Mandate Management**
   - Implement CRUD logic for Mandates (API + UI)
   - Mandate creation/editing form should be multi-section/tabbed (see PRD for required fields)
   - Mandate list view with filtering and search
   - Mandate detail view with sourcing notes field
2. **Candidate Management**
   - Implement CRUD logic for Candidates (API + UI)
   - Candidate form with resume upload (file handling)
   - Candidate list view with search/filter
   - Candidate profile view
   - Mechanism to link candidates to mandates (from candidate profile or mandate detail page)
3. **Linking & Relationships**
   - Implement UI and API for linking/unlinking Candidates and Mandates
   - Ensure data integrity and relationships in the database
4. **Search & Filter**
   - Add basic search/filter for Mandates and Candidates
5. **Testing**
   - Test CRUD operations for Clients, Mandates, Candidates
   - Test file uploads for mandates and candidates
   - Test linking of candidates to mandates
   - Verify data integrity and relationships in the database
   - Test usability of the multi-section Mandate form
6. **Styling & UX**
   - Refine forms and lists for Mandates and Candidates
   - Ensure consistent, modern UI/UX across all pages
   - Add feedback and error handling for all forms
7. **Documentation**
   - Keep this file updated with all major changes, design decisions, and next steps
   - Reference the PRD (phase1.md) for detailed requirements and field lists

## Error Log

(No errors as of last migration, API route scaffolding, auth setup, frontend auth pages, and client CRUD implementation)

## [2024-05-13] UI/UX Update: Sidebar Improvements

- Sidebar is now visible on all authenticated pages (not just dashboard)
- Sidebar is collapsible: users can toggle between full and minified (icon-only) views
- Sidebar now defaults to collapsed (icon-only) view after login
- Sidebar tooltips on hover when collapsed
- Sidebar includes: Overview, Clients, Mandates, Candidates, and user info with logout dropdown
- Sidebar hidden on /login and /register pages
- Logout dropdown closes on outside click
- Main content area automatically adjusts its left margin based on sidebar state (collapsed or expanded) for autoscaling
- No left margin/space on login/register pages
- SidebarContext is used to manage and share the collapsed state between sidebar and main layout
- Rationale: This provides a consistent, focused navigation experience after login and matches modern SaaS dashboard patterns

## Reference

- See `phase1.md` for the full PRD, user stories, and field requirements for Mandates and Candidates.
- All design/UX decisions are made to match the reference UI and PRD requirements.
