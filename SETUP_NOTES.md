# Setup and Debugging Notes

## Current Status

- Project initialized with Next.js
- Prisma schema updated with User, Client, Mandate, Candidate, and join tables
- Database connection verified
- Prisma migration and client generation successful
- API route scaffolding for Client, Mandate, Candidate, and linking completed
- Authentication flow implemented (NextAuth, registration endpoint, password hashing)
- Session protection added via middleware
- Frontend auth pages (login and register) created
- CRUD logic for clients implemented

## Steps to Debug and Fix

### 1. Prisma Schema Issues

- [x] Add missing Candidate model
- [x] Add proper relations between models
- [ ] Add file upload handling for resumes (to be handled in API/routes)
- [ ] Add audit trail fields where needed (future enhancement)

### 2. Database Connection

- [x] Verify DATABASE_URL in .env file
- [x] Test database connection
- [x] Run initial migration

### 3. Dependencies Check

- [x] Verify all required packages are installed
- [x] Check for version conflicts
- [x] Ensure Prisma CLI is properly installed

### 4. Next Steps

1. Implement CRUD logic for Mandates
2. Implement CRUD logic for Candidates
3. Create frontend components for forms and lists
4. Implement linking UI for Candidates <-> Mandates
5. Add basic search/filter for Mandates and Candidates

## Error Log

(No errors as of last migration, API route scaffolding, auth setup, frontend auth pages, and client CRUD implementation)
