# Setup and Debugging Notes

## Current Status

- Project initialized with Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Prisma schema updated with User, Client, Mandate, Candidate, and join tables
- Database connection verified and migrations applied
- Prisma client generated and used in API routes
- Authentication flow implemented (NextAuth, registration endpoint, password hashing, session protection)
- Middleware for route protection in place
- Frontend auth pages (login and register) created and styled
- Sidebar navigation implemented (collapsible, tooltips, logout dropdown, user info)
- Sidebar hidden on login/register pages
- Sidebar and main content layout responsive to sidebar state
- CRUD logic for clients implemented (API + UI)
- Dashboard page scaffolded with new layout

## Major Refactors & Improvements (May 13, 2025)

### 1. Unified Requirements/Mandates Workflow

- All references to "mandates" have been renamed to "requirements" for consistency across UI, navigation, and API routes.
- The `/requirements` workflow now includes list, detail, and multi-tabbed create/edit forms.
- API endpoints are now `/api/requirements` and `/api/requirements/[id]` (Prisma model remains `mandate`).
- Old mandates files and routes have been removed to avoid duplication.

### 2. Beautiful, Consistent Form Inputs

- Created `StyledInput`, `StyledSelect`, and `StyledTextarea` React components for all forms.
- All input, select, and textarea fields in the requirements workflow now use these components for a modern, accessible, and visually appealing look (subtle gray background, border, shadow, smooth transitions).
- These components are reusable and should be used in all new forms for consistency.

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements

- Requirements form is multi-tabbed, with each section clearly separated.
- All form fields are now visually distinct, even when not focused.
- Layout and navigation updated to reflect the requirements-first workflow.

## Steps to Debug and Fix

### 1. Prisma Schema & Database

- [x] Add missing Candidate model
- [x] Add proper relations between models
- [x] Add location and website to Client model
- [ ] Add file upload handling for resumes (to be handled in API/routes)
- [ ] Add audit trail fields where needed (future enhancement)

### 2. Database Connection

- [x] Verify DATABASE_URL in .env file
- [x] Test database connection
- [x] Run initial migration

### 3. Dependencies Check

- [x] Verify all required packages are installed
- [x] Check for version conflicts
- [x] Ensure Prisma CLI is properly installed
- [x] Install and configure react-icons

### 4. UI/UX & Layout Decisions

- [x] Sidebar is collapsible and defaults to collapsed (icon-only) after login
- [x] Sidebar tooltips on hover when collapsed
- [x] Sidebar includes: Overview, Clients, Requirements, Candidates, and user info with logout dropdown
- [x] Sidebar hidden on /login and /register pages
- [x] Logout dropdown closes on outside click
- [x] Main content area autosizes margin based on sidebar state
- [x] No left margin/space on login/register pages
- [x] Dashboard and all authenticated pages use the new layout
- [x] All navigation and section links are now in the left sidebar
- [x] Top bar removed for a cleaner, focused workspace

### 5. Mandate API Implementation

- [x] Implemented CRUD API for mandates:
  - [x] List mandates (GET /api/mandates)
  - [x] Create mandate (POST /api/mandates)
  - [x] Get single mandate (GET /api/mandates/[id])
  - [x] Update mandate (PUT /api/mandates/[id])
  - [x] Delete mandate (DELETE /api/mandates/[id])
- [ ] Frontend implementation for mandates (list, detail, create/edit form) is next

## Next Steps for Phase 1 (when resuming)

1. **Mandate/Requirement Management**
   - [x] Implement CRUD logic for Requirements (API + UI)
   - [x] Multi-section/tabbed form for create/edit
   - [x] List and detail views
   - [x] Consistent, beautiful form fields
2. **Candidate Management**
   - Implement CRUD logic for Candidates (API + UI)
   - Candidate form with resume upload (file handling)
   - Candidate list view with search/filter
   - Candidate profile view
   - Mechanism to link candidates to requirements (from candidate profile or requirement detail page)
3. **Linking & Relationships**
   - Implement UI and API for linking/unlinking Candidates and Requirements
   - Ensure data integrity and relationships in the database
4. **Search & Filter**
   - Add basic search/filter for Requirements and Candidates
5. **Testing**
   - Test CRUD operations for Clients, Requirements, Candidates
   - Test file uploads for requirements and candidates
   - Test linking of candidates to requirements
   - Verify data integrity and relationships in the database
   - Test usability of the multi-section Requirement form
6. **Styling & UX**
   - Refine forms and lists for Requirements and Candidates
   - Ensure consistent, modern UI/UX across all pages
   - Add feedback and error handling for all forms
7. **Documentation**
   - Keep this file updated with all major changes, design decisions, and next steps
   - Reference the PRD (phase1.md) for detailed requirements and field lists

## Error Log

(No errors as of last migration, API route scaffolding, auth setup, frontend auth pages, and client CRUD implementation)

## [2024-05-13] UI/UX Update: Sidebar Improvements

- Sidebar is now visible on all authenticated pages (not just dashboard)
- Sidebar is collapsible: users can toggle between full and minified (icon-only) views
- Sidebar tooltips on hover when collapsed
- Sidebar includes: Overview, Clients, Requirements, Candidates, and user info with logout dropdown
- Sidebar hidden on /login and /register pages
- Logout dropdown closes on outside click
- Main content area automatically adjusts its left margin based on sidebar state (collapsed or expanded) for autoscaling
- No left margin/space on login/register pages
- SidebarContext is used to manage and share the collapsed state between sidebar and main layout
- Rationale: This provides a consistent, focused navigation experience after login and matches modern SaaS dashboard patterns

## Reference

- See `phase1.md` for the full PRD, user stories, and field requirements for Requirements and Candidates.
- All design/UX decisions are made to match the reference UI and PRD requirements.
